        <h1>ABOUT ME</h1><br>
        
        <p>Hey there, I'm Guhan! I'm currently on a journey to earn my B.Tech degree.
        <br> Alongside my academic pursuits, I've developed a deep passion for technology and the arts. <br>
        As a full-stack developer, I have a solid foundation in creating dynamic web applications. <br>
        My true creative outlets lie in video editing and photography, where I tell compelling visual stories through the lens,
        capturing moments that speak volumes. <br> My video editing skills allow me to weave these moments into captivating narratives,
        ensuring each frame is meaningful and visually stunning.
        <br>I've also delved into IoT projects using Arduino, bringing innovation to life with smart solutions. <br>
        One of my notable achievements is developing a frontend page for esports registration, showcasing my ability to create seamless
        and engaging user experiences. <br>Whether I'm coding a new feature, editing a breathtaking scene, or working on cutting-edge IoT 
        projects, I thrive on the fusion of technology and creativity, always pushing the boundaries of what's possible.</p><br><br>
