        <p class="para">Esports  short for electronic sports, is a form of competition using video. <br>
             Esports often takes the form of organized, multiplayer video game competitions, particularly between professional players, individually or as teams. <br>

            Multiplayer competitions were long a part of video game culture, but were largely between amateurs until the late 2000s, when the advent of online streaming media platforms, particularly YouTube and Twitch, enabled a surge in participation by professional gamers . <br>
             By the 2010s, esports was a major part of the video game industry, with many game developers designing for and funding for tournaments and other events. <br>
            
            Esports first became popular in East Asia, particularly in China and South Korea (which first licensed professional players in 2000) but less so in Japan, whose broad anti-gambling laws prohibit professional gaming tournaments. <br>
             Esports are also popular in Europe and the Americas, which host regional and international events. <br>
            
            The most common video game genres associated with esports are multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA), first-person shooter (FPS), fighting, card, battle royale and real-time strategy (RTS) games. <br>
            Popular esports franchises include League of Legends, Dota, Counter-Strike, Valorant, Overwatch, Street Fighter, Super Smash Bros. and StarCraft. Among the most popular tournaments are the League of Legends World Championship, Dota 2's International, the fighting game-specific Evolution Championship Series (EVO) and Intel Extreme Masters. <br>
             Many other competitions use a series of league play with sponsored teams, such as the Overwatch League. Although the legitimacy of esports as a true sporting competition remains in question, they have been featured alongside traditional sports in some multinational events in Asia. <br>
             The International Olympic Committee has discussed their inclusion in future Olympic events. <br>
            
            In the early 2010s, viewership was about 85% male and 15% female, with most viewers between the ages of 18 and 34. <br>
             By the late 2010s, it was estimated that by 2020, the total audience of esports would grow to 454 million viewers, with revenue increasing to more than US$1 billion, with China accounting for 35% of the global esports revenue. <br></p>
